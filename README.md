# videos-to-top-hashtagas

## Initial Plan (2023 10 16)
1. Get Tiktok videos for each one of the most popular hashtags by using [open-source api](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api).
2. Make the functions to convert those videos into the useful and efficient matrices.
3. Make the model to predict the hashtags from the video.
4. Evaluate to optimize the model.

### This project will start from 5 of Nov. of 2023. (While moving place, I do not have time to start)

### The thing That I need to learn in this point:

1. how to convert videos to the matrices
2. how to make those matrices efficient and useful
3. which model should I use
